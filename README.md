## Introduction

This repository provides Python implementations of key algorithms and feasibility analysis techniques for the forthcoming paper:

**"On the Properties of the Metalog Distribution"**
by Manel Baucells, Lonnie Chrisman, Thomas W. Keelin, and Zixin Stephen Xu

The code offers tools to fit always-feasible Metalog 2.0 distributions, perform feasibility checks, compute moment statistics (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis), and identify modes, anti-modes, and roots. This repository is intended as a computational companion to the paper, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore Metalog distribution properties and apply them in modeling and optimization tasks.

## Overview

This repository contains two Python scripts:

* **`algo_astar.py`**: Computes the optimal coefficient vector $a^*$ for a Metalog distribution using constrained quadratic programming with Newtonâ€™s method and grid search for feasibility checking.
* **`feasibility_stats.py`**: Provides functions for feasibility checking, statistical moment calculation, and auxiliary computations, which support `algo_astar.py` and can be used independently.

Together, these scripts allow you to fit Metalog distributions, verify feasibility, and compute detailed statistics for analysis or reporting.

## Dependencies

All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them all at once by running:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Files and Functions

### `algo_astar.py`

Implements Algorithm 1 from the paper, fitting a feasible Metalog 2.0 distribution to `(x, y)` quantile-probability pairs.

**Main Function**
`find_a_star(k, x, y, tol=1e-6, epsilon=1e-6)`
Returns the optimal feasible coefficient vector $a^*$ and associated diagnostics (RSS, mean, variance, standard deviation, modes, antimodes, runtime).

**Supporting Functions** include:

* `calculate_Y(y, k)`: Build Metalog basis matrix
* `grid_search_newtons_method(...)`: Locate potential infeasible points
* `C_matrix(...)`: Build constraint matrix for QP
* `function_G`, `function_G_prime`, `G_value`: Define feasibility function and derivative

Example:

```python
import numpy as np
from algo_astar import find_a_star, calculate_Y

x = np.array([1, 2, 4, 8, 12])
y = np.array([0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9])
k = 4

a_star_result = find_a_star(k, x, y)
a_star = a_star_result["Best a*"]
print(a_star_result)
```

### `feasibility_stats.py`

Contains feasibility checking and statistical computation utilities.

**Main Functions**

* `feasible(a, tol=1e-6)`: Check density feasibility (interior and tail conditions)
* `summary_stats(a)`: Compute mean, variance, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and report modes/anti-modes

**Supporting Functions** implement moment integrals, root finding, and boundary analysis.

Example:

```python
from feasibility_stats import feasible, summary_stats

a = (22.62, 5.64, 3.19, 35.51)
print(feasible(a))
print(summary_stats(a))
```

## Special Note

To compute reliable `summary_stats`, you should first find a **feasible** coefficient vector $a^*$ using `find_a_star` or manually verify feasibility using `feasible(a)`. Calling `summary_stats` on an infeasible $a$ may yield misleading or undefined results.

## Notes on Usage

* **Tolerance (`tol`)** controls precision of feasibility checks and root finding.
* **Epsilon (`epsilon`)** in `find_a_star` enforces stricter inequality constraints for feasibility.
* The distribution is feasible only if its density is non-negative over `[0, 1]`.
